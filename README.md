This study developed a robust method to detect circular permutations in the Protein Data Bank, analyzing 287,081 proteins with sequence lengths under 800 residues. By employing FoldSeek and MMseqs2 for similarity searches and refining results with TM-align, icarus, and plmCP, we identified 20,801 potential circular permutation pairs and 3,351 unique circular permutation proteins. This approach advances our understanding of protein structural variations and evolutionary adaptations.
